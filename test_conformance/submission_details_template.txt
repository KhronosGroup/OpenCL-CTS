# Version of OpenCL specification being tested
#
OpenCL Version: Major.Minor

# Statement of conformance listing each conformant product (at a specific
# version) that is covered by this implementation. List each conformant product
# on a separate line starting "Conformant Product:". The first in the list
# is the product/device that the tests were actually run on.
#
# Each conformant product is likely to be one of:
#  * a type of computer (e.g. Windows XP PC) plus the software product
#    that contains this OpenCL implementation required to build and run
#    the tests, plus the OpenCL device tested, for example
#  * Conformant Product: Windows XP PC with Buzzleware OpenCL Library for Windows 0.2
#    with OpenCL running on a BrandX 322 PCIe GPU
#
Conformant Product:

# CPU type and instruction set architecture level required by the implementation
# and method of running the tests (for example X86_64 with SSE 4_2), and/or model
# number
#
CPU Type:

# OS with version number, including GUI framework if used by OpenKODE
# implementation, e.g. Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Symbian 9.1 UIQ 3.1
#
OS Name and Version Number:

# Tested compute device info, fill-in all the below fields for Compute Device, as returned by the clGetDeviceInfo query
#ex:
# Compute Device Type: CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU                       (show enum returned by CL_DEVICE_TYPE)
# Compute Device Name: Brand X 322 PICe GPU,                    (as returned by CL_DEVICE_NAME)
# Compute Device Version: OpenCL 2.0 MyGPU(TM) 1234,            (as returned by CL_DEVICE_VERSION)
# Compute Device Driver Version: OpenCL 2.0 build: 2.003.05.02  (as returned by CL_DRIVER_VERSION)
# Compute Device OpenCL C Version: OpenCL 2.0 MyGPU(TM) 1234    (as returned by CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION)
